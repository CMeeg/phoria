  <p><i>üèùÔ∏è Islands architecture for dotnet powered by ‚ö° Vite.</i></p>
  <hr /><br />
</div>

Phoria allows you to easily and efficiently render [islands of interactivity](https://docs.astro.build/en/concepts/islands/) using [React](https://react.dev/), [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) or [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) within your dotnet web app (Razor Pages or MVC) using both Client Side Rendering and Server Side Rendering.

* ‚ö° Built around [Vite](https://vite.dev/), which means you can enjoy a first class development experience, lightning fast HMR and access to its expansive plugin catalogue and ecosystem
* üèùÔ∏è Easily and efficiently render islands using any supported UI framework(s)
* üåä Client Side Rendering (CSR) and support for multiple client hydration strategies via client directives such as on load, on idle, on visible and on match media query
* üîã Server Side Rendering (SSR) of Islands within your dotnet web app (Razor Pages or MVC) views
* üì¶ Easily pass props from your dotnet web app to your UI components
* ‚öôÔ∏è Shared configuration between dotnet and Vite using `appsettings.json` files and a `dotnet dev-certs` plugin

## Acknowledgements

### Inspiration

The idea for this project came about after using [Astro](https://astro.build/) and thoroughly enjoying the whole experience with their implementation of the [Islands architecture](https://docs.astro.build/en/concepts/islands/). Astro was the catalyst and continues to inspire to this day.

The approach that the Remix team took to their [Vite plugin](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/guides/vite) and how they structure their applications is also a big inspiration.

This [presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ptqaqls2SYo) and [sample code](https://github.com/bholmesdev/vite-conf-islands-arch/blob/main/src/client.ts) by Ben Holmes (core maintainer of Astro) was the inspiration for the Phoria Island implementation.

### Implementation

This project would have been significantly slower to get off the ground if it wasn't for the amazing work done by the maintainers of:

* [Vite.AspNetCore](https://github.com/Eptagone/Vite.AspNetCore); and
* [NodeReact.NET](https://github.com/DaniilSokolyuk/NodeReact.NET)

Parts of their codebases are used in the dotnet Phoria library and helped form a solid foundation from which to build out the features that Phoria provides.
